# Math Whiz-ard

</div>

*Math Whiz-ard* is a web app that allows users to practice basic math problems. Intended mainly for kids in elementary or middle school, *Math Whiz-ard* is a web app that can help improve grades and test scores. Unlike Pearson practice tests, our product allows the user to practice as much or as little as they need to feel comfortable with the subject. Users can choose from an array of problem types, including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, algebra, and decimal operations.  Users will be shown the correct answer if they are wrong and once they are done will be shown their score and a short list of problems they got wrong. Lastly, like we have mentioned before, the UI is clean and simple; it is easily understandable and accessible for all, and the best part of the entire package is that there is no paywall!
